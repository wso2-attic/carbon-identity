<h1>OpenID provider - User Guide</h1>

<p>Once you enter an OpenID issued by the WSO2 Identity Server at any relying party end, you need to
   authenticate your self at the Identity Server end.</p>

<p>There are two main methods of authenticating to WSO2 Identity Server when it acts as the OpenID
   Provider.
   It is username/password based authentication and Information Card based authentication.</p>

<p>With Username/Password based authentication, users can authenticate using their credentials that
   they
   use to log into the management console.</p>

<br/>
<p>Or else, users can use an Information Card issued by the Identity Server or any
   managed/self-issued card
   that was used when signing up with the Identity Server.</p>

<br/>
<p>After providing the login credentials, it may prompt for multi-factor authentication if you it is
   enabled.</p>

<p>If authentication is successful, users will be asked to select a profile to used for attribute
   exchange. Identity Server will use this profile to extract the claims
   requested by the relying party.</p>
