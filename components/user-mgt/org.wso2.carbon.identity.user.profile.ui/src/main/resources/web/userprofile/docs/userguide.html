<h1>User Profile Management</h1>

<p>The User Profile Management component of the WSO2 Carbon facilitates the management
and control of user's details. The key functionalities of this component include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add new profiles (Note : New profiles can only be added if the Identity Server is connected to a JDBC user store)</li>
  <li>Add and modify details of a user in profile</li>
</ul>
<p>The user profile component can be invoked in two ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Administrator or a person with "Manage Security" functionality can add/edit/view profiles of users</li>
	<li>If the product is configured, the user himself can edit his profile</li>
</ul>

<i>External profiles of a JDBC user store can be viewed only</i>
