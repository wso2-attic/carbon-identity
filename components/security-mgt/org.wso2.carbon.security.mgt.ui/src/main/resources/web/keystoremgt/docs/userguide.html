<h1>Key Store Management</h1>



<p>Keystore management manages the keys that are stored in a database. A
Keystore must contain a key pair with a certificate signed by a trusted
Certification Authority (CA). The WSO2 Carbon
uses the JKS type private key called WSO2 Carbon. </p>

<h2>Adding a New Keystore</h2>

<p>WSO2 Carbon keystore management provides the facility to manage multiple keystores. It supports
two types of Keystores.</p>
<ul>
  <li>JKS (Java Key Store)
    It can read and store key entries and certificate entries. However,
    the key entries can store only private keys.
  </li>
  <li>PKCS12 (Public Key Cryptography Standards)
    You can read a keystore in this format and can export the information
    from that keystore, but you cannot modify the keystore. This is used to
    import the certificates from different browsers into your Java
    keystore.
  </li>
</ul>
