Following explain how to test WSO2 Identity Server's Passive STS using the sample Relying Party (RP)

Configuring the Relying Party
-----------------------------
In sample web app's web.xml...

1. for 'idpUrl', give Identiy Server's Passive STS URL.
		i.e. https://localhost:9443/passivests
2.'replyUrl' should be the URL of the web app.
		i.e. http://localhost:8080/PassiveSTSSampleApp/
3.'realm' should be an unique identifier for the web app.
		e.g. PassiveSTSSampleApp

Configuring Identity Server (IS)
-------------------------------
1. In IS Management Console, go to 'Security Token Service'.
2. Go to 'Passive STS Configuration' in it.
3. Click 'Add new trusted service'.
4. For 'Service Realm Name' give the same identifier we gave as realm in Web app
5. Select claims. These will be returned to the RP by the IS.

Execution Flow
--------------
1. From a web browser, try to access 'http://localhost:8080/PassiveSTSSampleApp'
2. This request will be intercepted by a Servlet Filter and browser will redirect to IS' Passive STS service.
3. Passive STS prompts the user for credentials.
4. After obtaining the credentials, it will construct the response with the selected claims.
5. Then, Passive STS redirects the browser to the RP.
6. Finally, web browser will display the response received by the IS.
