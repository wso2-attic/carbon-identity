WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0
==========================

Welcome to the WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0 release.

WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Entitlement management server. It supports a wide array of authentication 
protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive. 
It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is 
supported through SCIM and SPML.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.

New Features
============

* Identity Bridge -
  WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0 is capable of translating between heterogeneous authentication protocols and transforming 
  and mediating any identity assertion, between SAML2.0, OAuth 1.0a/2.0, OpenID, OpenID Connect, WS-Federation Passive. 
  This leads to seamless integration between internal applications and cloud applications such as Salesforce, Google Apps 
  and Office 365.

  Few example use cases.

  - Login to your corporate Salesforce or Google Apps accounts from your Facebook credentials.
  - Login to your laptop connected to your corporate Windows domain - you will be automatically logged into your corporate Salesforce and Google Apps accounts.
  - Login to corporate Office 365 account - you will be automatically logged into you Google Apps and Salesforce accounts.
  - Login to Identity Server user portal - you will be automatically logged into your internal Liferay portals.

* Multi-option and multi-step authentication -

  With WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0, a given service provider (irrespective of the protocol it supports) can select the 
  login options it wants to present to it users. Authentication can be a mix of two types: Multi-option login and 
  multi-step login. With multi-option authentication - the user will be presented with a login screen to pick whatever the authentication mechanism he/she wants (e.g.: Username/password, Social login with Facebook, Login with a federated Home Identity Provider). A service provider can also choose to have multi-step authentication. Multi step authentication can naturally be extended to be multi-factor depending on the kind of authentication. 

* Request Path Authenticators.

  The responsibly of getting the user's credentials is left to the service provider, and the credentials will be 
  attached to the request to the Identity Server. 

* Social Login with Facebook / Google / Microsoft Windows Live.

  Facebook / Google / Microsoft Windows Live authenticators are the very first authenticators we are shipping with 
  Identity Server 5.1.0 for social login. 

* Ability to plug-in custom developed authenticators.

  Owing to the power of OSGi, custom authenticators can be easily written and put into the Identity Server which 
  will pick them dynamically and execute. The UI will also be extended with property fields for administrators to 
  configure the authenticators if they are federated authenticators.

* Provisioning Bridge.

  WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0 is capable of accepting inbound provisioning requests based on SOAP or SCIM, 
  provisioning to the Resident Identity Provider using LDAP, Active Directory, JDBC or Carbon Remote UserStoreManagement 
  user management APIs, and transform them to outbound provisioning requests based on SCIM, SPML 2.0, Salesforce, 
  Google Apps provisioning APIs.

* Just-in-time provisioning.

  In the process of federated login WSO2 Identity Server is capable of provisioning the corresponding subject to a 
  preferred user store domain as well as other configured Identity Providers.

* Ability to plug-in custom developed provisioning connectors.

  Like with authenticators provisioning connectors also can be added to the system by implementing the relevant 
  APIs and dropping them to the system as OSGi bundles
  
* User Dashboard.

  WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0 ships with a jaggery based user dashboard to expose end user functionality. 
  This dashboard is completely decoupled from the management console, and is completely extensible due to the fact that 
  it is able to render gadgets. The application can run from within IS or as a separate jaggery app on AS.

* SAML2 Web SSO profile Request / Response validator.

  A UI based tool in the Identity Server 5.1.0 management console for debugging the SAML2 Web SSO requests and responses.

* Remote User Store Management.

  WSO2 Carbon's User/Group Administration SOAP API is also now supported as part of the UserStoreManager 
  implementations shipped by default. This means heterogeneous user stores distributed across different data centers 
  can be managed from a single Identity Server node.

* Custom permissions.

  Application specific permissions can be added by service providers and assigned to roles, and by using the 
  remote authorization API do permission based access control for users.

* Encrypted SAML2 Assertions.

  The SAML2 assertion issued for SAML2 based SSO login can now have encrypted assertions. To decrypt the assertion 
  the service provider will have to have the Identity Server tenant's public certificate

* NTLM grant type for OAuth 2.0

Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
----------------------------------------------------------

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration. 
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to 
secure them with default mode. 

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool 
	script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)  

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually 

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.  
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class. 

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files 
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory. 

2. Start server by running wso2server sciprt from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password 
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key) 

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)
